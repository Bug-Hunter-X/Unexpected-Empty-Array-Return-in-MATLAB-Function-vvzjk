# MATLAB Empty Array Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue in MATLAB programming involving unexpected empty array returns from functions.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that can return an empty array under certain conditions. The calling script does not correctly handle this possibility, leading to potential errors.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the script, which includes robust checks for empty array returns.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.m` to observe the incorrect behavior.
3. Run `bugSolution.m` to see the corrected implementation.

## Lessons learned
Always thoroughly check the return values of your functions, especially when dealing with arrays. Ensure your code handles empty arrays gracefully to avoid unexpected errors.
